/**** This class defines the blueprint of a binary tree  
 **** A binary tree has a root that is a node of type BTNode, a size (the total number of 
 **** nodes in the tree originated at the root) and a height (the maximum distance between 
 **** the root and its deepest leaf). 
 **** Most of the code is given to you. You are asked to complete a few TODOs as shown below. 
 **** There are 2 TODOs in this file (TODO 4 and TODO 5) as well as 1 BONUS.
